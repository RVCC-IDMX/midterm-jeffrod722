                <h2>About Ellescaped</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Emily Lescano and I love all things fashion. I was the president of a club during
                    my college years called RUThrifty, where the goal of the club is to show and tell people about the
                    ways and benefits of upcycling your clothing and showing new ways of altering and working with the
                    pieces you already have</p>

                    <h3>Project 1 : Denim Dress</h3>
                    <p>This dress is made up of old denim jeans my father no longer needed. I decided to test my skills
                        and make my own dress out of them. </p>

                    <h3>Project 2 : Mushroom Girl Costume</h3>
                    <p>The mushroom outfit was made from scratch with leftover fabric from high-end fashion boutiques
                        in
                        New York City that were saved from the landfill and resold, plus cardboard and other 'trash'
                        household
                        items that otherwise would have been thrown out into a landfill</p>

                        fit but I also
                        couldn't really donate</p>

                <p>I always come to Emily if I want something altered on a uniform, adjusted to fit my needs, or for
                    general fashion tips because she really is a jack of all trades! She does it all!</p>

                <p>The way I dress and go about carrying myself in public is all inspired by Emily. She confidently
                    carries herself and gives me the motivation I need to fully express myself with no doubts.</p>
